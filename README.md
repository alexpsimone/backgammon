# backgammon
I'm learning Python basics by building the classic board game.

My long-term goals for this game include: separating all functions into individual files / (by proxy) eliminating my reliance on the use of global variables / incorporating a GUI into the game (if possible) / embedding this game into a personal website (if possible) / going back and generally cleaning up and streamlining the code, once all of the functionality works (I am aware of how repetitive some of the syntax is at the moment)
